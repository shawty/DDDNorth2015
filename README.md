# DDDNorth2015
Code and solution files built under Visual Studio 2013 for my talk on "Micro-service Architectures" at DDDNorth on the 24th October 2015.

If you simply just clone the solution, you'll get 4 projects ready to set up under IIS, and all set to restore NuGet packages on build (Using the new method :-) )

|You'll also find a copy of the slides from the presentation, along with my notes in the root of the solution folder.
